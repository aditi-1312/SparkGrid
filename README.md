# Energy Optimization Platform

## Overview

The **Energy Optimization Platform** is an innovative solution designed to tackle the challenges of energy efficiency and sustainable power generation. Built using advanced AI/ML models and blockchain technology, this platform predicts energy demand, optimizes energy generation, and fosters a transparent and eco-friendly energy ecosystem.

## Features

- **Demand Prediction**: Predict energy demand with 93.87% accuracy using Gradient Booster models.
- **Generational Optimization**: Optimize power plant production using a custom LSTM model.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensure transparency in energy distribution and carbon credit trading with decentralized technology.
- **User Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard to view energy usage, carbon footprint, and credits.
- **Authentication**: Secure role-based access for businesses, regulators, and users.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, MongoDB
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts and decentralized ledgers
